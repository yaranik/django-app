# django-app/Blogxt
It is my public blog
Now you can:
- make account
- make posts
- only registered users can change posts and comments
- add comments to posts
- make post now and publicate it later

Some minuses about project:
- has not yet been configured access to posts
- the project has a simple registration without confirmation
